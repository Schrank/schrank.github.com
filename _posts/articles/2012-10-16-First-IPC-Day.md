# First day of the IPC

## Talks

There are a lot of interessting talks. I heard:

* Domain Specific Languages (Tobias Schlitt, Gordon Oheim)
* Living with Legacy (Sebastian Bergmann, [Slides](http://thephp.cc/dates/2012/international-php-conference/phpunit-best-practices))
* Rethinking the Artichtecture of a modern CMS (Lukas Smith, Henri Bergius)
* PHPUnit Best Pratice (Sebastian Bergmann, [Slides](http://thephp.cc/dates/2012/international-php-conference/phpunit-best-practices))
* Designing Beautiful APIs (Tobias Schlitt)

## Domain Specific Languages (DSL)

DSLs are Languages designed for exact one domain (one purpose), e.g. [SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [LDAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP#Protocol_overview) or [PCRE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCRE).

But the talk itself were about external and internal DSLs.

### External DSLs

An external DSL is a DSL which you use between different organizations or companies, for example [BEHAT] and [MINK]. You can describe business cases with these tools and the customer can define **exactly** what an application should do.

And with behat and mink you can generate test cases out of this definition.

### Internal DSLs

Internal DSLs are more technical languages you use inside your projects. Toby showed a tool to generate html slides out of code files, with a simple syntax which lines should be included and which lines should be highlightet on which slide.

## Living with Legacy

I think this talk was like the PHPUnit Best Pratice and the beautiful APIs talk.


## Rethinking the Artichtecture of a modern CMS

This talk was awsome. I'm really unhappy that I didn't listen quite well, because I tried to set up this blog. I think I'm not able to sum up this talk :-(
