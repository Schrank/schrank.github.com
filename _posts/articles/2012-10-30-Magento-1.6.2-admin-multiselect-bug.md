In the adminbackend in Magento is a bug, which prevents a multiselect to become empty. 

# &lt;select&gt;

A `<select>` element is not submited, if no option is selected. To submit a value you need to render a `<input type="hidden" />` element before it. This way, the variable is set in `$_GET` or `$_POST` and may be overwritten by the `<select>`.

# Bug in magento
This `<input type="hidden" />` is not rendered before Version 1.7.0.0-alpha1.

# Fix

Thanks to [this thread](http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/264254/#t398477) I found a quick, good fix (as magento fixed it in versions > 1.7.0.0-alpha1):

	// app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/Block/Widget/Form.php:203
    } else if ($inputType == 'multiselect') {
		$element->setValues($attribute->getSource()->getAllOptions(false, true));
		$element->setCanBeEmpty(true); // add this line
        
        
        
The line number is from version 1.7.0.2
